# Implementation Summary: Indeed Support

## Overview
Successfully added Indeed job site support to the Kununu Badge extension, enabling the badge to appear on both StepStone and Indeed job pages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Manifest Configuration (`manifest.json`)
**Updated:**
- Extension name: "Kununu Badge for StepStone" → "Kununu Badge for Job Sites"
- Description: Added "and Indeed" to reflect multi-platform support
- Content scripts matches: Added 10 Indeed regional domains
  - `*.indeed.com` (US, international)
  - `*.indeed.de` (Germany)
  - `*.indeed.co.uk` (UK)
  - `*.indeed.ca` (Canada)
  - `*.indeed.fr`, `*.indeed.es`, `*.indeed.it`, `*.indeed.nl`, `*.indeed.at`, `*.indeed.ch` (European regions)

### 2. Content Script (`content/content.js`)

#### Function: `extractCompanyFromAnchor()` (Lines 165-250)
**Added:**
- Strategy 1a: Indeed company name extraction
  - Looks for `.e1wnkr790` class (Indeed's company container)
  - Extracts text from `<a>` tag inside
  - Fallback to direct textContent if no anchor found
- Renamed existing strategy to "Strategy 1b: StepStone"

#### Function: `findCompanyAnchor()` (Lines 535-605)
**Added:**
- Strategy 1a: Indeed anchor detection
  - Primary: `.e1wnkr790` element
  - Fallback selectors: `.css-1ygeylu`, `[class*="e1wnkr"]`, `[data-company-name]`
- Renamed existing strategy to "Strategy 1b: StepStone"
- Updated selector list with Indeed-specific selectors at the top

#### Function: `isJobDetailPage()` (Lines 610-664)
**Added:**
- Indeed element detection: `.e1wnkr790` presence check
- Indeed URL pattern detection:
  - `/viewjob?jk=` (direct job view)
  - `/?vjk=` (job selected in listing view)
- Indeed content indicators: `.e1wnkr790`, `.css-1ygeylu`, `[data-company-name]`

#### Function: `gatherBadgeDiagnostics()` (Lines 690-715)
**Added:**
- Indeed element diagnostics:
  - `indeedCompany` section tracking `.e1wnkr790` element
  - Link detection and text extraction
- Updated test anchor selection to include `.e1wnkr790` as first priority

### 3. Header Comments
**Updated:**
- `content/content.js`: Updated to "Kununu Badge Content Script for Job Sites"
  - Added supported platforms list
- `content/diagnostics.js`: Updated to reflect multi-platform support

### 4. Documentation Updates

#### `README.md`
**Updated:**
- Title: "Kununu Badge for Job Sites"
- Description: Added Indeed support
- Installation: Updated extension name reference
- Testing: Added complete Indeed testing section
  - Navigation instructions
  - Both URL pattern testing
  - Expected results

#### `TESTING.md`
**Updated:**
- Added "Basic Functionality Test - Indeed" section
- Added Indeed-specific SPA navigation tests
- Instructions for testing both URL patterns (`/viewjob?jk=` and `/?vjk=`)

#### `ARCHITECTURE.md`
**Updated:**
- High-level diagram: "StepStone Page" → "StepStone / Indeed Page"
- Extension initialization flow: Added platform detection step
- Content scripts matches example: Added Indeed domains

## Key Technical Details

### Indeed-Specific Implementation
1. **CSS Class**: `.e1wnkr790` is the primary identifier for Indeed company containers
2. **HTML Structure**: Company name is in an `<a>` tag within the `.e1wnkr790` container
3. **URL Patterns**: 
   - Direct: `/viewjob?jk=<job_id>`
   - Listing: `/?vjk=<job_id>` (when job is selected in sidebar)

### Priority Order
The extension now checks for platform-specific elements in this order:
1. Indeed elements (`.e1wnkr790`)
2. StepStone elements (`.job-ad-display-du9bhi`)
3. Generic fallback selectors
4. Floating mode (if no suitable anchor found)

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Needed
- [ ] Test badge on Indeed.de job detail page (`/viewjob?jk=`)
- [ ] Test badge on Indeed.de listing with selected job (`/?vjk=`)
- [ ] Test badge on other Indeed domains (`.com`, `.co.uk`, etc.)
- [ ] Verify company name extraction accuracy
- [ ] Test badge positioning (inline mode expected)
- [ ] Test SPA navigation on Indeed
- [ ] **Regression**: Verify StepStone functionality still works
- [ ] Test toggle on/off on both platforms

### Console Logs to Monitor
Look for these console messages:
- `[Kununu Badge] Initializing on <url>`
- `[Kununu AutoSlug] Company: <company_name>`
- `[Kununu Badge] Badge inserted in inline mode`

### Expected Behavior
✅ Badge appears near company name on Indeed job pages
✅ Badge appears on both URL patterns (`/viewjob` and `/?vjk`)
✅ Badge extracts correct company name
✅ Badge repositions on SPA navigation
✅ StepStone functionality unchanged (regression test)

## File Changes Summary
- ✅ `manifest.json` - Added Indeed domains, updated name/description
- ✅ `content/content.js` - Added Indeed detection and extraction logic
- ✅ `content/diagnostics.js` - Updated header comment
- ✅ `README.md` - Added Indeed documentation
- ✅ `TESTING.md` - Added Indeed test cases
- ✅ `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Updated architecture diagrams
- ✅ `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Created (this file)

## Next Steps
1. Reload the extension in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/`)
2. Test on Indeed.de job pages
3. Test on StepStone (regression)
4. Verify no console errors
5. Test toggle functionality on both platforms
6. Consider adding more regional Indeed domains if needed

## Rollback Instructions
If issues arise, revert these files to previous commits:
- `manifest.json`
- `content/content.js`
- Documentation files (optional)

The extension will revert to StepStone-only functionality.
