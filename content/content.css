/**
 * Content CSS for Kununu Badge Extension
 * 
 * NOTE: This file is intentionally minimal/empty.
 * 
 * All badge styles are defined inline within the Shadow DOM
 * in content.js for complete style isolation. This ensures
 * that page styles cannot affect the badge and vice versa.
 * 
 * Shadow DOM provides stronger encapsulation than separate
 * CSS files injected into the page context.
