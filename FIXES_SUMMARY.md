# Fixes Summary - Company Lens

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Side Panel Opening Error

**Problem:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'open')
at content/content.js:1889 (handleComparisonRequest)
```

**Root Cause:**
- `chrome.sidePanel.open()` was being called from the content script
- Side Panel API can only be called from background scripts or extension pages
- Content scripts don't have access to this API

**Solution:**
- Moved side panel opening logic to background script
- Content script now sends message `OPEN_SIDE_PANEL` to background
- Background script handles opening the side panel with proper context
- Added proper error handling for Chrome versions < 114

**Files Changed:**
- `content/content.js` - Changed to send message instead of direct call
- `background.js` - Added `handleOpenSidePanel()` function

---

### 2. ✅ Complete Job Data Logging for Diagnostics

**Problem:**
- Not enough diagnostic information to verify if job data was loaded successfully
- Hard to debug extraction issues

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive console logging for job extraction
- Logs show:
  - Job title
  - Company name
  - Description length (in characters)
  - Requirements length (in characters)
  - Complete job data object

**Example Output:**
```
[Company Lens] Job extracted successfully:
  Title: Senior Software Engineer
  Company: SAP
  Description length: 2847 characters
  Requirements length: 543 characters
  Full job data: {title: "...", company: "...", ...}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `content/content.js` - Enhanced `extractJobDescription()` function

---

### 3. ✅ Badge Opens Comparison Results (Like Diagnostics)

**Problem:**
- No easy way to re-open comparison results after initial view
- Badge only opened Kununu preview
- Not consistent with diagnostics badge behavior

**Solution:**
- Badge now checks if comparison results exist for current job
- If results exist, clicking badge opens side panel with results
- If no results, clicking badge opens Kununu preview (as before)
- Added visual indicator (green dot) when comparison results are available
- Smart detection: only shows indicator if results match current job URL

**Features:**
1. **Visual Indicator:**
   - Green dot appears on badge when comparison results available
   - Tooltip: "Click to view CV comparison results"

2. **Smart Behavior:**
   - Checks if stored comparison matches current job
   - Opens side panel if match found
   - Falls back to Kununu preview if no match

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Falls back to Kununu preview if side panel fails to open
   - Graceful degradation for older Chrome versions

**Files Changed:**
- `content/content.js` - Updated badge click handler and styles

## Technical Implementation Details

### Side Panel Opening Flow

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Content Script │
│  (job page)     │
└────────┬────────┘
         │ 1. User clicks Compare
         │ 2. Extract job data
         │ 3. Store loading state
         │
         ├──→ chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
         │      type: 'OPEN_SIDE_PANEL'
         │    })
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   Background    │
│   Service       │
│   Worker        │
└────────┬────────┘
         │ 4. Receive message
         │ 5. Get window ID from sender
         │ 6. Check sidePanel API available
         │
         ├──→ chrome.sidePanel.open({
         │      windowId: windowId
         │    })
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   Side Panel    │
│   Opens         │
└─────────────────┘
```

### Badge Click Behavior

```
User clicks badge
        │
        ├──→ Check storage for comparison results
        │
        ├──→ Has results for this job?
        │       │
        │       ├─ YES ──→ Open Side Panel
        │       │          with comparison results
        │       │
        │       └─ NO ───→ Open Kununu Preview
        │                  (company ratings)
        │
        └──→ On error ───→ Fallback to Kununu Preview
```

### Visual Indicator Logic

```css
.kununu-badge--has-comparison::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: -2px;
  right: -2px;
  width: 8px;
  height: 8px;
  background: #4caf50;  /* Green dot */
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: 2px solid white;
  box-shadow: 0 0 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}
```

## Debugging Console Commands

Open DevTools Console (F12) and try:

```javascript
// Check if side panel API is available
console.log('sidePanel API:', typeof chrome.sidePanel);

// Check stored comparison results
chrome.storage.local.get('companyLens_lastComparison', (result) => {
  console.log('Last Comparison:', result);
});

// Check current job URL
console.log('Current URL:', window.location.href);

// Manually trigger side panel opening
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ type: 'OPEN_SIDE_PANEL' }, (response) => {
  console.log('Side panel response:', response);
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Side Panel Still Won't Open

**Check:**
1. Chrome version: `chrome://version/` - Must be 114+
2. Extension reloaded after changes
3. Check background script console:
   - Right-click extension icon → "Manage extension"
   - Click "service worker" link
   - Check for errors

**Common Issues:**
- **"sidePanel API not available"**: Chrome version < 114
- **"Could not determine window ID"**: Rare race condition, try again
- **Permission denied**: Check manifest.json has `sidePanel` permission

### Green Dot Not Appearing

**Check:**
1. Comparison actually completed (check side panel)
2. On the same job URL
3. Storage has comparison results:
   ```javascript
   chrome.storage.local.get('companyLens_lastComparison', console.log);
   ```

**Fix:**
- Run another comparison
- Check console for storage errors
- Verify job URL matches

### Badge Always Opens Kununu Preview

**Possible Causes:**
1. Comparison failed
2. Different job URL
3. Storage cleared

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Check what's in storage
chrome.storage.local.get('companyLens_lastComparison', (r) => {
  console.log('Has comparison:', !!r.companyLens_lastComparison?.comparison);
  console.log('Job URL:', r.companyLens_lastComparison?.jobDescription?.url);
  console.log('Current URL:', window.location.href);
  console.log('URLs match:', r.companyLens_lastComparison?.jobDescription?.url === window.location.href);
});
```
